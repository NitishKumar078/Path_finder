## Project Description

This project implements and demonstrates the functionality of five distinct pathfinding algorithms. The main focus is on solving maze-like structures using these algorithms. A comprehensive analysis has been conducted to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, providing valuable insights into their performance.

## Features

- Implementation of five pathfinding algorithms:
  1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
  2. A* Algorithm
  3. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  4. Depth-First Search (DFS)
  5. Greedy Best-First Search

- Comprehensive analyses comparing algorithm performance:
  - Evaluation in solving maze-like structures
  - Strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm

- User-friendly Interface:
  - Positive feedback received on the user interface
  - Accessible and engaging design

## Getting Started
This project allows users to interactively explore and compare five distinct pathfinding algorithms. Follow these steps to use the application:

1. **Selecting Algorithm:**
   - On the user interface, choose from the available pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS, Greedy Best-First Search).

2. **Throwing Obstacles:**
   - Create maze-like structures by adding obstacles to the canvas.

3. **Setting Points:**
   - Optionally, set the starting and destination points by dragging and placing them on the canvas.

4. **Drawing/Modifying Obstacles:**
   - Users can draw, add, or remove obstacles by interacting with the canvas. Clicking on the canvas allows for easy manipulation of the maze.

5. **Start:**
   - Initiate the pathfinding process by clicking the "Start" button.
